        "question": "Is external audit mandatory for my company in Dubai?",
        "answer": "Yes, most companies in Dubai require external audits. All LLCs, branches of foreign companies, public and private joint stock companies, and most free zone entities must have their annual financial statements audited by a ministry-approved auditor. Some free zones have revenue thresholds below which audit is optional."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does an external audit take?",
        "answer": "A typical external audit takes 3-4 weeks from start to finish, depending on company size and record quality. We offer express services for urgent requirements, which can complete the audit in 2 weeks. The process involves planning (1 week), fieldwork (1-2 weeks), and reporting (1 week)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to provide?",
        "answer": "You'll need to provide financial statements, general ledger, bank statements, invoices, contracts, payroll records, tax filings, articles of association, and trade license. We provide a detailed checklist during the planning phase tailored to your business."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between external and internal audit?",
        "answer": "External audit is an independent examination by third-party auditors required by law, focusing on financial statement accuracy. Internal audit is an ongoing evaluation of internal controls and risk management, typically performed by in-house or contracted auditors for management purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are you approved by the Ministry of Economy?",
        "answer": "Yes, Farahat & Co is fully approved by the UAE Ministry of Economy to conduct statutory audits. We are also recognized by DFSA, ADGM, and all major free zones across the UAE. Our auditors hold international certifications including CPA, CA, ACCA, and CIA."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you audit if my accounts are not up to date?",
        "answer": "Yes, we can help. We offer accounting cleanup services to bring your books up to date before the audit begins. This ensures a smooth audit process and may be more cost-effective than trying to audit incomplete records."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if you find errors in my financial statements?",
        "answer": "If we identify material misstatements, we discuss them with management and provide opportunities to make adjustments. Most errors can be corrected before the final audit report. Our goal is to help you present accurate financial statements while maintaining audit independence."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide the audit report in Arabic?",
        "answer": "Yes, we provide audit reports in both English and Arabic to meet Ministry of Economy requirements. All financial statements and accompanying notes are translated by qualified professionals to ensure accuracy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does an external audit cost?",
        "answer": "External audit fees typically range from AED 15,000 to AED 60,000+ depending on company size, complexity, and industry. Factors include annual revenue, number of locations, transaction volume, and timeline. We provide fixed-price quotes after an initial consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I start my annual audit?",
        "answer": "Ideally, start your audit 2-3 months before your filing deadline. This allows time for proper planning, fieldwork, and any necessary adjustments. Many companies begin their audit immediately after year-end closing to ensure timely submission to the Ministry."

        "answer": "Yes, they serve different purposes. External audit validates financial statements once a year. Internal audit continuously monitors operations, identifies risks, and improves controls throughout the year. Many companies benefit from both - external audit for compliance, internal audit for risk management and operational improvement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should internal audits be conducted?",
        "answer": "It depends on your risk profile and size. Many organizations conduct internal audits quarterly or semi-annually for high-risk areas, annually for medium-risk areas, and every 2-3 years for low-risk areas. We help develop a risk-based audit plan tailored to your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you be our internal audit department?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer co-sourced and fully outsourced internal audit services. This is often more cost-effective than hiring full-time internal audit staff, while providing access to specialized expertise and industry best practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What areas can internal audit cover?",
        "answer": "Internal audit can cover any aspect of your business: financial controls, operational processes, IT systems, compliance, procurement, inventory management, sales, HR processes, fraud risk, and more. We tailor scope to your specific risk areas and priorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is internal audit confidential?",
        "answer": "Yes, we maintain strict confidentiality. Internal audit findings are typically reported to senior management and the audit committee. We work collaboratively with management to address issues while maintaining independence and objectivity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does an internal audit take?",
        "answer": "A typical process or department audit takes 3-6 weeks, depending on scope and complexity. Ongoing internal audit retainers involve continuous work throughout the year with regular reporting cycles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you help with SOX compliance?",
        "answer": "Yes, we have extensive experience helping companies prepare for and maintain SOX compliance. Our internal control documentation, testing, and reporting meet SOX requirements. We can also assist with SOX 404 compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What qualifications do your internal auditors have?",
        "answer": "Our internal audit team includes Certified Internal Auditors (CIA), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE), CPAs, and ACCA professionals with deep industry experience across UAE sectors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you audit our IT systems and cybersecurity controls?",
        "answer": "Yes, we have IT audit specialists who can assess IT general controls, cybersecurity measures, data privacy compliance, system access controls, and IT governance. We also coordinate with specialized IT security firms when needed."

      {
        "question": "What triggers an FTA VAT audit?",
        "answer": "FTA may audit businesses based on risk indicators including frequent late filings, large refund claims, industry-specific patterns, inconsistent returns, or random selection. Proactive VAT audits help you prepare and identify issues before FTA scrutiny."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a VAT audit take?",
        "answer": "A proactive VAT health check takes 1-2 weeks. Comprehensive VAT audits typically take 3-4 weeks. If you've received an FTA audit notice, timeline is often driven by FTA deadlines (usually 20 business days to respond)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is voluntary disclosure and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "Voluntary disclosure is proactively reporting VAT errors to FTA before they discover them. If you identify VAT mistakes (under-reported output tax, over-claimed input tax), voluntary disclosure can reduce penalties from 50% to as low as 5% of the tax amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common VAT compliance mistakes?",
        "answer": "Common errors include incorrect VAT treatment of transactions, input tax claimed on exempt supplies, missing or incomplete tax invoices, late filings, errors in cross-border transaction treatment, and improper use of reverse charge mechanism."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you represent us during an FTA audit?",
        "answer": "Yes, we provide full FTA audit support including document preparation, response drafting, representation in FTA meetings, and penalty negotiation. Our expertise helps minimize exposure and resolve audits efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need for VAT audit?",
        "answer": "You'll need VAT returns, general ledger, tax invoices (sales and purchases), import/export documentation, exemption certificates, credit/debit notes, adjustment records, and VAT account reconciliations. We provide a detailed checklist."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much are FTA penalties for VAT violations?",
        "answer": "Penalties vary: AED 1,000-15,000 for administrative violations (late filing, no tax invoice), 50% of tax for late payment, 50% of tax difference for errors (reducible to 5-30% via voluntary disclosure), and up to 300% for tax evasion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do all businesses need VAT audit?",
        "answer": "VAT audit is not legally mandatory for all businesses (unlike financial statement audit). However, it's highly recommended if you receive FTA audit notice, have complex VAT scenarios, claim large refunds, or want proactive compliance assurance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you help with VAT refund applications?",
        "answer": "Yes, we verify VAT refund claims for accuracy and supporting documentation before submission to FTA. This reduces rejection risk and ensures you can substantiate all input tax recovery claims if questioned."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if we made VAT errors in previous years?",
        "answer": "If you discover historical VAT errors, we recommend immediate voluntary disclosure to FTA to minimize penalties. We help quantify the error, prepare disclosure documentation, and manage the submission process to achieve the best outcome."
