# Transfer Pricing Documentation Requirements for UAE Corporate Tax

**Do your Dubai business transactions with related parties comply with UAE transfer pricing rules?** Since corporate tax implementation in June 2023, the UAE requires businesses conducting related party transactions to maintain comprehensive transfer pricing documentation proving all dealings are at "arm's length" market rates. Non-compliance carries penalties up to 300% of tax underpaid—plus potential criminal prosecution for intentional violations—making transfer pricing the highest-risk area of UAE corporate tax compliance.

As Ministry-approved auditors serving over 28,000 UAE businesses (many with complex group structures), we've witnessed how transfer pricing transforms from an overlooked technicality into a AED multi-million penalty exposure almost overnight. The challenge: UAE's transfer pricing framework, while based on OECD guidelines, contains local nuances, specific documentation requirements, and aggressive FTA enforcement approaches that catch even sophisticated multinational groups off-guard.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll discover what constitutes related party transactions under UAE law, the complete arm's length principle framework and testing methodologies, master file and local file documentation requirements with templates, specific UAE compliance deadlines and submission procedures, strategic transfer pricing planning to minimize tax exposure while maintaining compliance, and the advanced techniques multinational groups use to defend pricing methodologies during FTA audits.

## Understanding UAE Transfer Pricing Framework

The UAE's transfer pricing regime represents one of the most comprehensive international tax compliance frameworks in the Middle East, aligning closely with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines while incorporating specific local requirements.

### What is Transfer Pricing?

**Transfer pricing** is the practice of setting prices for transactions between related entities (companies under common ownership or control). These "controlled transactions" include:

- Sale of goods between parent and subsidiary
- Provision of services from one group company to another
- Licensing of intellectual property within corporate group
- Intercompany loans and financing arrangements
- Cost-sharing arrangements
- Management fees and administrative charges

**The Core Problem**: Related parties could manipulate pricing to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions and losses to high-tax jurisdictions, artificially reducing overall tax liability.

**The Solution**: Arms-length pricing requirements ensuring related party transactions use market rates.

### Legislative Basis

UAE transfer pricing rules derive from multiple sources:

**Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022** (Corporate Tax Law):
- Article 34: Transfer pricing and arm's length principle
- Article 35: Documentation requirements
- Article 36: Advance pricing agreements

**Cabinet Decision No. 44 of 2023**:
- Detailed transfer pricing regulations
- Documentation thresholds
- Filing requirements
- Penalties for non-compliance

**Ministerial Decision No. 97 of 2023**:
- Transfer pricing return forms
- Disclosure requirements
- Record retention

### OECD Alignment

The UAE explicitly adopted **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines** as the foundational framework:

**OECD Guidelines Incorporated**:
- Arm's length principle (Article 9 OECD Model Tax Convention)
- Comparability analysis
- Transfer pricing methods
- Documentation standards (BEPS Actions 8-10, 13)
- Country-by-Country Reporting (BEPS Action 13)

**UAE-Specific Additions**:
- Lower documentation thresholds than many OECD countries
- Faster implementation timeline
- Stricter penalties for non-compliance
- Specific industry guidance for common UAE sectors

### Why Transfer Pricing Matters for UAE Businesses

**Prevalence of Related Party Transactions**:
- ~78% of UAE businesses are part of larger corporate groups
- Free zones host thousands of regional headquarters with intragroup transactions
- Dubai and Abu Dhabi serve as GCC/MENA regional hubs

**High FTA Scrutiny**:
- Transfer pricing is a top priority for FTA audits
- ~35% of initial corporate tax audits focus on transfer pricing
- Average transfer pricing adjustment: AED 2.3 million

**Severe Penalties**:
- Late/incomplete documentation: AED 10,000 - 50,000
- Underpriced transactions: Up to 50% of tax shortfall
- Intentional manipulation: Up to 300% + criminal prosecution

### Scope of UAE Transfer Pricing Rules

**Who Must Comply**:
- ✅ All UAE resident entities with related party transactions
- ✅ Free zone companies (including qualifying free zone persons)
- ✅ Branches of foreign companies with intragroup dealings
- ✅ Natural persons conducting business with related parties
- ✅ All businesses regardless of size (no small business exemption)

**Exemptions**:
- ❌ Transactions between UAE tax group members (eliminated on consolidation)
- ❌ Certain government-to-government transactions
- ❌ Very limited other exceptions

### Transaction Scope

**Covered Transactions** (must be at arm's length):
- Sale/purchase of tangible goods
- Provision of services (management, technical, administrative)
- Use of tangible assets (equipment rental, property lease)
- Transfer/use of intangible assets (IP licensing, trademarks, patents)
- Financial transactions (loans, guarantees, cash pooling)
- Cost contribution arrangements
- Business restructurings

### 💡 What Others Won't Tell You

**The FTA's transfer pricing enforcement team includes former Big 4 transfer pricing specialists** recruited specifically to identify manipulation. Unlike some tax authorities with limited transfer pricing expertise, UAE's team understands:

- Industry-standard intercompany charges
- Common profit-shifting techniques
- Red flags in transfer pricing reports
- Weaknesses in comparability analyses

This creates a fundamentally different risk profile than many businesses expect. Generic transfer pricing documentation that might pass muster in jurisdictions with less sophisticated review will trigger immediate challenge in UAE.

Additionally, **the FTA has access to Country-by-Country Reports** (CbCR) filed by ultimate parent companies under BEPS Action 13. If your UAE entity is part of a multinational group with consolidated revenue >EUR 750 million, the FTA can see:
- Global profit allocation across all countries
- Effective tax rates in each jurisdiction
- Whether UAE entity's profitability aligns with functions performed

Businesses assuming "the FTA won't know about our global structure" face unpleasant surprises when FTA agents arrive with printouts of CbCR data showing suspiciously low UAE profits despite significant operations.
